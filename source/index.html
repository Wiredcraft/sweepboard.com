  <section class='why'>
    <h2>Why SweepBoard?</h2>
    <p>We love GitHub, but its issue queue can get messy:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Issues get buried</strong> and people tend to focus more on the newest issues.</li>
      <li><strong>It's hard to prioritize</strong> when issues are displayed as a flat list.</li>
      <li><strong>Navigating issues is cumbersome</strong>. Switching threads and adding new issues quickly turn into page refresh galore.</li>
    </ul>
